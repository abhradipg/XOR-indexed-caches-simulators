The data we provide (obtained from our experiments and related work) is under this directory.

Subdirectories
- "duration" contains simulation/analysis duration data for warping/Dinero/HayStack/PolyCache.
- "miss" contains cache miss data for warping/Dinero/HayStack/PolyCache/Papi.
- "json" contains warping cache simulation outputs.

Any data related to related work PolyCache is extracted from their POPL paper.
Any data related to HayStack/DineroIV is obtained by using the PLDI HayStack artifact.
